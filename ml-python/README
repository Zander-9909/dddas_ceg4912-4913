Setup for OverlayLandmarks
You must install CMake and pip3
Use sudo pip3 install to install the python packages:
    opencv-python
    imutils
    scipy
    numpy
    mlxtend
Use the "setup.py" in the dlib submodule to install dlib (use as sudo) [sudo python setup.py install]
Then to run OverlayLandmarks, run sudo python3 OverlayLandmarks.py arg1 arg2
Arg1 is the period for picture taking, in ms. 
arg2 is to select which camera to use (if a device has multiple). 0 is for the default, 2 for a secondary one.
