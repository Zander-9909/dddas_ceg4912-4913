Setup for OverlayLandmarks
You must install CMake and pip3
sudo apt-get install -y cmake pip3 python3-opencv python3-skimage

Next, build the submodule dlib from within the /dlib directory in the repo
sudo python setup.py install

Use pip3 to install the pip dependencies needed  from the requirements.txt file in /ml-python
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt

***------------------------TO FIX MLXTEND PROBLEM-------------------------------------***
Go into /usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/mlxtend/image and edit the path in extract_facial_landmarks where it is looking for the .dat file to the local directory in this project. This only appeared on the RaspPi.
***-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------***

Then to run OverlayLandmarks, run 
sudo python3 OverlayLandmarks.py arg1 arg2

arg1 is the period for picture taking, in ms. 
arg2 is to select which camera to use (if a device has multiple). 0 is for the default, 2 for a secondary one.
