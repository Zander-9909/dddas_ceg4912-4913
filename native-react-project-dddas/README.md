# Source directory for Native React front-end

This Native React project is setup with [Expo Go](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 

To start the expo server, make sure to run 'npm install' to download all the dependencies, as they are not stored in the repo. Then simply run the command 'npx expo start'.
