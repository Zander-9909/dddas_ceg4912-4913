# Drowsy (and) Distracted Driving Avoidance System
The DDDAS will be able to monitor and track biometrics of the driver. It will alert the driver by
vibrating the steering wheel and playing a notification sound. The DDDAS will be connected to an
eLog tablet through USB tether to have further access to functions that will be used to detect a
crash, such as inertial sensor, a GPS with access to google maps, and a microphone.

In the case of all 3 detecting, it will automatically call emergency services, however when only 1
or 2 go off, it will ask the driver if it will be necessary through sound and vibrating the steering
wheel in intervals, and will call if there is no response from the driver
